## Project description

The goal of this project is to develop a personalized friend recommendation system by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We analyze data from Facebook, Google+, or Twitter to suggest meaningful connections based on user profiles and interactions.

## Functions of the files in the repository

- **Dockerfile**  
The initial version of the dockerfile for containerization
- **Friend_recommendation.ipynb**  
The main ipython notebook containing the code for data acquisition, analysis and preparation
- **requirements.txt**  
The list of necessary python packages
- **twitter_featurenames_clusters**  
Saved artifact of a word clustering used for data preparation. The project can be run without it present but it greatly speeds up the process when present
